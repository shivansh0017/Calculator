Scenario 1: Normal Scenario where operatorBackground has been set
Details:  
    TestName: getOperatorBackgroundWhenSet.
    Description: This test is meant to check the getOperatorBackground method when the operatorBackground has been set to a certain value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the operatorBackground to a certain value.
    Act: Invoke the getOperatorBackground method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with the set value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getOperatorBackground method returns the correct value that has been set. It's significant in the context of application behavior as it ensures the correct operatorBackground is returned.

Scenario 2: Scenario where operatorBackground has not been set
Details:  
    TestName: getOperatorBackgroundWhenNotSet.
    Description: This test is meant to check the getOperatorBackground method when the operatorBackground has not been set. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not set the operatorBackground.
    Act: Invoke the getOperatorBackground method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getOperatorBackground method returns null when the operatorBackground has not been set. This is significant as it ensures the method behaves correctly when the operatorBackground is null.

Scenario 3: Scenario where operatorBackground is set to an empty string
Details:  
    TestName: getOperatorBackgroundWhenEmpty.
    Description: This test is meant to check the getOperatorBackground method when the operatorBackground has been set to an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the operatorBackground to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the getOperatorBackground method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value with an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getOperatorBackground method returns an empty string when the operatorBackground is set to an empty string. This is significant as it ensures the method behaves correctly when the operatorBackground is an empty string.
