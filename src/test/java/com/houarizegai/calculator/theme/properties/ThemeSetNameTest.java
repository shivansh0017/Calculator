  Scenario 1: Test setName with a valid string value

  Details:  
    TestName: setNameWithValidString.
    Description: This test is meant to check the setName method when it is provided with a valid string value. The target scenario is the normal use case where the user provides a valid string as the name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string with a valid name.
    Act: Invoke setName with the created string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name field has been set to the provided string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the setName method correctly sets the name field when provided with a valid string. This is important as it is the basic functionality of the setName method.

  Scenario 2: Test setName with an empty string

  Details:  
    TestName: setNameWithEmptyString.
    Description: This test is meant to check the setName method when it is provided with an empty string. The target scenario is when a user provides an empty string as the name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty string.
    Act: Invoke setName with the empty string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name field has been set to the empty string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the setName method correctly sets the name field when provided with an empty string. It is important to test this scenario to ensure that the method can handle edge cases.

  Scenario 3: Test setName with a null value

  Details:  
    TestName: setNameWithNullValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check the setName method when it is provided with a null value. The target scenario is when a user provides null as the name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are testing with null.
    Act: Invoke setName with null.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name field has been set to null.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the setName method correctly sets the name field when provided with null. It is important to test this scenario to ensure that the method can handle null values without throwing exceptions. 

  Scenario 4: Test setName with a string containing special characters

  Details:  
    TestName: setNameWithSpecialCharacters.
    Description: This test is meant to check the setName method when it is provided with a string containing special characters. The target scenario is when a user provides a string with special characters as the name.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a string containing special characters.
    Act: Invoke setName with the created string.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name field has been set to the provided string.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the setName method correctly sets the name field when provided with a string containing special characters. This is important to test to ensure that the method can handle different types of string inputs.
