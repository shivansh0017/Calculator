  Scenario 1: Valid Hexadecimal Color Code

  Details:  
    TestName: testValidHexColorCode.
    Description: The test is designed to validate the hex2Color method when provided with a valid hexadecimal color code. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a valid hex color code, for example "FFA500" which represents the color orange in hexadecimal format.
    Act: Invoke the hex2Color method with the valid hex color code as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual Color object returned by the method against the expected Color object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly converts a valid hexadecimal color code into a Color object. The expected result is a Color object that represents the color orange. 

  Scenario 2: Invalid Hexadecimal Color Code

  Details:  
    TestName: testInvalidHexColorCode.
    Description: The test is designed to validate the error handling of the hex2Color method when provided with an invalid hexadecimal color code.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide an invalid hex color code, such as a string that is not a valid hexadecimal number or a string of incorrect length.
    Act: Invoke the hex2Color method with the invalid hex color code as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method handles invalid inputs correctly by returning null. 

  Scenario 3: Null Hexadecimal Color Code

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullHexColorCode.
    Description: The test is designed to validate the error handling of the hex2Color method when provided with a null input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Provide a null input to the method.
    Act: Invoke the hex2Color method with null as a parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the method returns null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method handles null inputs correctly by returning null. The expected result is null, as there is no valid color that corresponds to a null hexadecimal color code.
